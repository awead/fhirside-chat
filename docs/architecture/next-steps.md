# Next Steps

## Implementation Priorities

**Immediate (Current Sprint):**
1. ✅ Complete architecture documentation
2. Continue development following architecture patterns
3. Maintain 80%+ test coverage

**Short-Term (Next 1-3 Months):**
1. Add circuit breaker pattern for external APIs
2. Implement caching layer (Redis) for patient histories
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Create health check endpoint
5. Add API versioning strategy

**Medium-Term (3-6 Months):**
1. Implement authentication and authorization
2. Enable HTTPS/TLS
3. Add database persistence for chat sessions
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Deploy to staging environment

**Long-Term (6-12 Months):**
1. Production deployment with HA
2. HIPAA compliance certification
3. Multi-region deployment
4. Advanced caching and performance optimization
5. ML model fine-tuning for clinical summaries

## Handoff to Development

**Architecture document complete!** Development can proceed with confidence:

1. **Reference this document** for all architectural decisions
2. **Follow coding standards** strictly
3. **Maintain test coverage**
4. **Use existing patterns** defined in Components section
5. **Security awareness:** Understand current limitations

**For New Features:**
1. Review relevant architecture sections
2. Follow established patterns (agents, models, endpoints)
3. Add tests before implementation (TDD)
4. Update architecture document if introducing new patterns
5. Get architecture review for significant changes
